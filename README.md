Simple white board clap so you always have a paper ready when you need it.

Used worn out belts and 6 mm left over plywood. Holes are same dimensions as a hole puncher.
Finish that was used is a wax polish

Easy to use just split a4 paper and use a hole puncher on a6 setting I use leftover prints in an attempt to save the forrest.
